# This is an example for a .dev-init-symlinks.txt file
# If any a file with that name is present in the root of a cloned repository or in your CONFIG/dev-init directory
# it will be processed and symlinks will be created

# Each (non-empty, non-commented-out) line represents a file or folder to be symlinked
# Each line has the following format:
# <file> [target=<target>] [template=<template>] [empty]
# File is either a relative path in the current directory or an absolute path elsewhere on the filesystem
# Template must be a relative path to a template file
# If "empty" is specified, then an empty file will be created if none is found.
# If neither template nor empty are specified, then the script will exit if the file doesn't exist
# If target is specified, it will be the relative path within the config directory to store the file
# If target is not specified, then a name will be automatically generated based on the relative path to the symlink and the parent directory

# Examples:
# .env template=.env.template
# application/config/flags.php empty target=myrepo-flags.php
